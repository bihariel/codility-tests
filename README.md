# CODILITY TESTS
In this repo I will implement some algorithms you could find in recruitment platforms like "codility"
The idea is to be selftrained, and also to help you to check your skills if you're looking for a new job

If you want to add a test, don't hesitate to contact me (jesusmvillarvazquez@gmail.com)

## Find the max binary gap
A binary gap is a collection of 0's between 1's. So:

1000 -> is not a binary gap
10001 -> is a binary gap with a size of 3

100101001 -> it has three binary gaps with a maximum gap of two

Please, code a solution to calculate the maximum binary gap for a given integer. Check the next examples

100 -> 0 (4 in decimal)
1001 -> 2 (9 in decimal)
101001000100001 -> 4 (21025)
10100 -> 1 (20)

* Find my solution in the "test" folder, I coded it using TDD :)
